# Savvy

Savvy is a powerful but lightweight object-oriented template system for PHP.

Unlike other template systems, Savvy by default does not compile your
templates into PHP; instead, it uses PHP itself as its template language so you
don't need to learn a new markup system.

## Note for php 8.1

For php 8.1 we swapped using Saltybeagle's package to this repo. We did this so we can more easily update and maintain the package.
